 # Backupscript
 
 Client that connects to the server and downloads the backup.
    The client sends the onetime password and the APIKEY to the server.
    The server verifies the APIKEY and the onetime password.
    If the APIKEY and the onetime password are correct, the server
    creates a temporary file and writes the backup to it.
    The backup folder is different for each client.
    THE OTP IS encrypted using public key cryptography.
    The backup is encrypted by the server.

    This file can be run by a cronjob.


    Todo:
    - Maybe a GUI to configure the client
    - put backup into different folder per project
    - Send email if failed
    - define cronjob.
    - test backup if it contains sql (search for create)
    - test backup if it can be decrypted
    - add create database to sql export
    - remove older exports?


    This script is used to backup the database.
   The client sends the onetime password and the APIKEY to the server.
   The server verifies the APIKEY and the onetime password.
   If the APIKEY and the onetime password are correct, the server
   creates a temporary file in memory and writes the backup to it.
   It then echos the content of the file.
   
   The backup is tested if it contains sql (search for create)
   
  TODO:
  - MySQLDump was changed, move change outside project. / document change
  - Document how to install / can dependencies be removed?
  - always install in seperate folder?
